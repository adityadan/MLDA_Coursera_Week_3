# MLDA_Coursera_Week_3
For week 3 assignment, I am running a lasso regression model that works on a data set used to predict the weight of a given cat based on other physical characteristics. In this data set we have five predictor variables: three quantitative (body_length, tail_length, height) and two qualitative (tail_texture and coat_colour). Tail_texture takes on values 0 and 1 which represent "smooth" and "bushy" respectively. Coat_colour takes on two values 0 and 1 which represent "yellow" and "grey" respectively. The lasso regression model uses a 5 fold model to eliminate predictors that have regression coefficient tending to zero.
